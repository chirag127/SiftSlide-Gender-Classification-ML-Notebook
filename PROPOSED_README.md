### 4. APEX NAMING CONVENTION (THE "STAR VELOCITY" ENGINE)
A high-performing name must instantly communicate **Product**, **Function**, **Platform** and **Type**.

**Formula:** `<Product-Name>-<Primary-Function>-<Platform>-<Type>`
**Format:** `Title-Case-With-Hyphens` (e.g., `ChatFlow-AI-Powered-Real-Time-Chat-Web-App` or `ZenRead-Book-Reader-CLI-Tool`).

**Rules:**
1.  **Length:** 3 to 10 words.
2.  **Keywords:** MUST include high-volume terms.
3.  **Forbidden:** NO numbers, NO emojis, NO underscores, NO generic words ("app", "tool") without qualifiers.
4.  **Archival Protocol:** If `action` is "ARCHIVE", you **MUST** still generate a new everything (name, description, topics, README) (e.g., `Advanced-Python-CLI-Tool`). The name must be **just as descriptive and professional** as an active repo. And everything should be updated also. But the archive archival should happen after the Updation
